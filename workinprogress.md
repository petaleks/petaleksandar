(draft version, previously circulated as "Spatial Memory or Spatial Shock: Employing Transactional Spatio-Temporal GARCH on Housing Prices")

Abstract:

This research analyzes persistence and asymmetry in the housing price volatility in time and space at micro transactional level. The proposed spatial-temporal
ARCH and GARCH model is applied to unbalanced non-repetitive sales data from Jönköping, Sweden, from 2012 through 2019. Results show significant difference in
the price volatility patterns between the market segment of apartments and houses. Estimated parameters for the market segment of apartments show positive memory effect, along with positive shock response, and confirm the assumption of spatialtemporal persistence in the variance. In the spatial dimension the market for houses shows highest response, but in the spatial-temporal domain houses show lower shock response compared to the apartments market. Regarding the house segment, the results show that higher constant volatility is compensated by lower effects in shock response, memory and asymmetry. Apartments show significantly higher response to negative price shocks than to the positive price shocks. This asymmetry is clearly observed in the spatial context compared to the spatial-temporal one.

Keywords: spatial-temporal, ARCH, GARCH, transactions model, housing price volatility, volatility persistence, volatility asymmetry, housing market segments, Sweden

Abstract:

This paper develops a theoretical search model of apartment swap in the rental market. Using random matching mechanism, we mimic the informal Swedish swap market, which is characterized by strong rent control and dominant ownership of the apartments by municipalities. Our proposed framework captures supply and demand dynamics of the rental market, segmented into households with rented small or big municipal apartments, searching and trying to swap apartments between each other. In the basic setup, in isolation of rental market, the value of the swap is a function of the structure of the population, probabilities of match, probability of cancelling the swap agreement and the differential in the utility gains of matching swap counter-parties. When integrated with the classical rental market, the swap market reflects not only the supply/demand conditions in the swap market, but also the tightness in the rental market. Vice-versa, a well developed swap rental market affects the rental market, so with an increase in the probability of successful swap of a particular rental apartment, the apartment rent value increases.

Keywords: Apartment swap, housing market, rent control, mismatch costs, search & match model, low supply, Sweden
